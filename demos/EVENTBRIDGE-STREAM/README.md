[Trigger](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/6268fde338b8161a2847cdba#triggers/632c25a835905156a392f321) is set up on tommcc-democluster-0 from database EVENTBRIDGE-STREAM with collection "events".

May need to restart trigger. Right now, eventbridge rule configured to send all events to [cloudwatch](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-north-1#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/FawsFeventsFtommcc-mongodb-events).
